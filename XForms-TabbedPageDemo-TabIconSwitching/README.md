TabbedPageDemo
==============

The Xamarin.Forms *TabbedPage* allows easy navigation among several similar pages.
The actual implementation of *TabbedPage* is different on the iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone platform.
As this sample program demonstrates, it is easiest to set the *ItemsSource* property of *TabbedPage*
to a collection of data items, and use data-binding in XAML to define a user interface
that displays these items.

The TabbedPageDemo displays information about three species of primates with photographs from Wikipedia. 

**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**
