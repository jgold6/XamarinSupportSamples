		<h1>Exercise 5: Use Resources to incorporate custom labels and icons</h1>

		<h2>Duration</h2>
		<p>10 minutes</p>

		<!-- - - - - - - - - Goals - - - - - - - - -->

		<h2 id="goals">Lab goals</h2>
		<p>
			The Phoneword application currently uses the default Android image for its icon and the Xamarin Studio project name as its label
			which is not ideal from a user-information or branding perspective. The goal of this lab is to utilize custom icons and labels
			for each of your activities and for the application as a whole.
		</p>

		<p>
			The images below show the how the app's activities will look at the end of this exercise. Notice how each has a unique icon
			and an appropriate text label at the top.
		</p>
		<table class="indent-none">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="./res/images/Part5a.Phoneword-Emulator.png" /></td>
				<td><img src="./res/images/Part5b.Phoneword-Emulator.png" /></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			These last two images show how the app will look on the Android screens. On the left is the
			<strong>Launcher</strong> screen and on the right is the <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong> screen.
		</p>
		<table class="indent-none">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="./res/images/Part5c.Phoneword-Emulator.png" /></td>
				<td><img src="./res/images/Part5d.Phoneword-Emulator.png" /></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			Here is a high-level description of the required tasks for this lab:
			<ol class="indent-medium">
				<li>Remove the existing <strong>drawable</strong> folder and replace it with the supplied folders containing custom icons.</li>
				<li>Set the application <strong>Label</strong> and <strong>Icon</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set the <strong>Label</strong> and <strong>Icon</strong> for <strong>MainActivity</strong> and <strong>CallHistoryActivity</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>Required assets</h2>
		<p>
			The provided <strong>Part 05 Resources</strong> folder contains resources that you will need in order to complete the lab:

			<ul class="indent-medium">
				<li>
					A starter solution with the completed code from the previous part which you can use if you did not do the previous exercise
					or if you would like to begin with a fresh project. The starter solution is in the <strong>Part5.Start</strong> folder.
				</li>

				<li>
					Icons in multiple sizes, each in a folder that indicates its size: <strong>drawable-ldpi</strong>, <strong>drawable-hdpi</strong>, etc.
				</li>

				<li>
					A completed version of the lab in the <strong>Part5.Completed</strong> folder if you would like to check your work.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Please make sure you have this folder before you begin.
		</p>

		<h2>Exercise challenge</h2>
		<p>
			Use the information in the <a href="./worksheet.html#part5">worksheet</a> to accomplish the <a href="#goals">tasks outlined above</a>.
			Alternatively, you can use the <a href="#steps">step-by-step instructions</a> provided below to work through the exercise.
		</p>

		<!-- - - - - - - - - Steps - - - - - - - - -->

		<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to incorporate custom icons and labels.
		</p>

		<div class="hintblock">
			<strong>Note:</strong> you can either continue your work from the prior exercise or use the provided starter solution.
		</div>

		<h3>Verify the default icons and labels</h3>

		<p>
			Before you begin customizing the icons and labels, please take a moment to examine how the app looks in its current state.
			Deploy the Phoneword app to the emulator or to your device. Look at how Phoneword is displayed on both the
			<strong>Launcher</strong> screen and the <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong> screen. Run the application and note the icon
			and label used on each of the two activities. Close the app when you are finished and return to Xamarin Studio.
		</p>

		<h3>Adding supplied icons</h3>

		<p>
			Here you will replace the default icons in your project with custom icons. The custom icons are supplied in several sizes
			so there will be several folders to add to your project.
		</p>

		<ol class="indent-medium">
			<li>
				In the <strong>Solution</strong> pad, right-click on the <strong>Resoures &gt; drawable</strong> folder
				and choose <strong>Delete</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Use Windows <strong>File Explorer</strong> or Mac <strong>Finder</strong> to locate the six folders named <strong>drawable</strong> in the supplied
				<strong>Part 05 Resources</strong> folder (one of the six is simply named <strong>drawable</strong> while the
				other five have a suffix such as <strong>-mdpi</strong>). Drag all six folders from <strong>File Explorer</strong> or <strong>Finder</strong>
				into Xamarin Studio and drop them on the <strong>Resources</strong> folder in your project. This will copy the
				folders and their contents to your project folder and add them to your project. It also correctly sets
				the <strong>Build Action</strong> on each file to <strong>Android Resource</strong>. Alternatively, you could
				create the folders manually in Xamarin Studio and add the individual files; however, drag-and-drop is much
				more convenient.
			</li>

			<li>
				Take a moment to examine the contents of the six <strong>drawable</strong> folders in your project.
				Notice that the same files appear in each folder, with the icons rendered at different resolutions.
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h3>Setting the application Icon and Label</h3>

		<p>
			Here we will set the application-level <strong>Icon</strong> and <strong>Label</strong>.
		</p>

		<ol class="indent-medium">
			<li>
				Open <strong>Resources &gt; values &gt; Strings.xml</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				It is typical to define the application name as a resource string; the project template already created a string
				for this which we will modify. Change the <strong>app_name</strong> to <strong>ApplicationName</strong> and set the value
				for the entry to "Phoneword Translator".
<p>
<a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this, 'applicationNameResource'); return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
<div class="indent-medium" id="applicationNameResource" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;string name="ApplicationName"&gt;<span class="highlight">Phoneword Translator</span>&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>
</div>
</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				Open the <strong>Project Properties</strong> and select the <strong>Android Manifest</strong> tab.
			</li>

			<li>
				Set the <strong>Application name</strong> and <strong>Application Icon</strong> values as shown
				below.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/XamarinStudio-SetApplicationNameAndIcon.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>

			<li>
				Deploy the application to the emulator or your device (you can also run the app if you would like to
				but deployment is all that is needed for this part). Navigate to the <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong>
				screen in Android. Verify the listing for Phoneword uses the application name and icon
				you set in the previous step.

				<div class="hintblock">
					<strong>Note:</strong> these application-level settings are used as the defaults for your activities;
					if you have any activities without these settings supplied, you will see these application-level values
					used there during app execution.
				</div>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Setting the activity Icons and Labels</h3>

		<p>
			Here we will set individual <strong>Icon</strong> and <strong>Label</strong> values for the two activities.
		</p>

		<ol class="indent-medium">
			<li>
				Open <strong>MainActivity.cs</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Locate the <code>ActivityAttribute</code> applied to the <code>MainActivity</code> class.
				Set the <code>Label</code> to "Translate" and the <code>Icon</code> to "@drawable/translate".
				<div class="hintblock">
					<strong>Note:</strong> The orignal values for the <strong>MainActivity</strong> <code>Icon</code>
					and <code>Label</code> might be more appropriate than the values you just set. Once you have
					finished the exercise and understand where these values are used, feel free to reset them to
					"Phoneword" and "@drawable/icon" as before.
				</div>
			</li>

			<li>
				Open <strong>CallHistoryActivity.cs</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Locate the <code>ActivityAttribute</code> applied to the <code>CallHistoryActivity</code> class.
				Set the <code>Icon</code> to "@drawable/history". The <code>Label</code> was set in a previous
				exercise so there should be no need to modify it here.
			</li>

			<li>
				Run the application and verify the <strong>Icon</strong> and <strong>Label</strong> are correct
				for your two activities. Examine the launcher screen to verify the <strong>Icon</strong> and
				<strong>Label</strong> for the <strong>MainActivity</strong> are used.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p>
			This lab added custom labels and icons both at the activity and application level.
			The application-level values represent the application as a whole and appear on the
			Android <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong> screen. They also serve as fallback values for the
			corresponding activity-level values. Keep in mind that for activities that act as
			app entry points, the activity-level values will be used on the launcher screen and
			not the application-level settings.
