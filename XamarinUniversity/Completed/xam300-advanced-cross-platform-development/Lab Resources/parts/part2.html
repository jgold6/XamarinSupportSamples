    <h1>Exercise 2: Build a Service Locator</h1>
    <h2>Duration</h2>
    <p>15 minutes</p>
        
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
    This exercise will define a service for performing text-to-speech and then create a Service Locator to find the implementation of that service which is platform-specific. This is intended to be done as part of the online class, if you are working through this on your own you can watch the recorded session to get the details for this exercise.
    </p>

    <h2>Assets</h2>
    <p>
    This exercise includes a starter project in the <strong>Part 02 Resources</strong> folder, or you can continue from the prior exercise.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
    We will need to perform several steps to get the Text-To-Speech service integrated.
    <ol>
        <li>First, we will need to define an abstraction for the service - this will be an interface, named <code>ITextToSpeech</code> that will be placed into the Portable Class Library.</li>
        <li>Next, we will add implementations into our two platform-specific projects; the implementations have already been created and are in the <strong>Part 02 Resources</strong> folder.</li>
        <li>We will add a <strong>Service Locator</strong> into the project - this has also been provided in the resources folder.</li>
        <li>Next, our platform-specific code will register the implementation with the abstraction in the service locator - this will allow any part of our solution to locate the implementation, while only depending on the interface.</li>
        <li>We will then add some code into the <code>GreatQuote</code> to say the quote using the text-to-speech service and invoke that code when you tap on the quote in the detail view.</li>
