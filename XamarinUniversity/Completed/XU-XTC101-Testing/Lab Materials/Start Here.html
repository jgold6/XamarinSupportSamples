    <section id="main">

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        This class introduces the student to how to test applications using NUnit, Xamarin.UITest and Calabash and then have those tests upload to Test Cloud to see how those tests would perform on a wider range of devices.</p>

        <h2>Estimated Time: 2 Hours</h2>

        <h2>Slides</h2>
        <p><a href="./parts/slides.pdf">XTC101 - Introduction to Testing and Test Cloud</a>.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><div class="objective">Introduction to Testing</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part1">Worksheet</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, you will learn the how to create tests, how to understand the unique aspects of testing mobile apps.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Unit Testing</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part2">Worksheet</a>
            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br />
            In this exercise, you will understand how to create unit tests with NUnit, how to name and structure them as well as best practices.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Xamarin.UITest</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part3">Worksheet</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, you will learn how to test the user interface of your apps with Xamarin.UITest. You will learn how to run your 
            app on the simulator or device, how to use the REPL tool to find views on your User Interface.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Calabash</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part4">Worksheet</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, you will be introduced to Cucumber, a framework for defining specs in a business friendly language called Gherkin and then 
            have those tests execute either using built in steps or using Ruby code.
            </li>
            
           	<li><div class="objective">Test Cloud</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part5">Worksheet</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise we will use the tests that we have executed locally and then upload them to Test Cloud to see how they would perform
            on a wider range of devices. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
        To complete the coding exercise for this class, you will need either an Android or an iOS development setup.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS</strong>
            <br />
            You will need a computer with Mac OS X, Apple's XCode development environment and Xamarin 3.0 installed to be used as the Build Machine. You can then either use this same machine with Xamarin Studio, or you can use a Windows machine with the Xamarin tools and Visual Studio to do the code editing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Android</strong>
            <br />
            You will need either a Mac OS X computer with Xamarin tools and the Android SDK, or a Windows computer with Visual Studio, Xamarin tools and the Android SDK. In addition, if you do not have an Android device, you will need to setup the Android emulator, Genymotion virtual machine, or use the built-in Xamarin Android Player beta.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calabash</strong>
            <br />
            You will need to install the Calabash tools on your Mac on Windows machine to allow for local testing of your iOS or Android apps. Instructions for installation can be found <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/osx-installation/">here</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If you need help setting up your environment, <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/" target="_blank">try going through the online setup</a> instructions. In addition, we have documented all the setup requirements and have walk-through videos on the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements" target="_blank">Xamarin University website</a>.
