The new codebase should ultimately provide TouchDB support for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 devices.\n\nTouchDB-Mono is still in very early, pre-alpha stages. This talk will introduce the existing TouchDB projects and will explore the efforts required to port a Java application to C# using Sharpen.

Unfortunately, they are also API-like in nature, requiring initialization/calls in a particular sequence and in having to manage their state externally. Creating complex effects also often involves writing/generating a combination of shaders, code and data files \u2013 which can often get out of sync or be hard to maintain.\n\nGraffiti bucks the trend by providing a simple set of declarative-syntax based open source libraries that are set-up-and-go oriented. Almost all of the data Graffiti needs is designed to be written directly as readable, markup-like C# code (or serialized/deserialized), which makes it robust and type-safe. Core tenets of Graffiti include Quake 3 style shaders, simple key frame based animation and batched rendering. Each module of Graffiti is focused on a handful of tasks, which other pieces leverage.\n\nIt is also written on top of XNA/MonoGame and its most compatible profile (Reach), which makes it exceedingly cross platform. The goal is to create a truly cross-platform set of game libraries which can help create professional-looking games with far less effort and a different approach, one that is better suited to the increasingly expressive languages available for the .NET/Mono frameworks today.",

The project makes heavy use of Xamarin and Microsoft tools to implement the remotes sensors, central servers and control nodes for sending commands to sensors.  This talk will present a brief overview of the research that drove this project, the current state of the design and architecture and will examine the code that implements the various nodes in this topology.  The system designers will discuss the use of .NET in all three layers of the architecture and will walk through the code to demonstrate how the core classes and interfaces were implemented as common libraries that compile without modification in MonoDevelop and Visual Studio.  The cross-platform design will be demonstrated using an iOS client and also a Windows Phone client in addition to the ASP.NET MVC 3 server running on IIS.  Sensor to server communication will be demonstrated using a web service layer (based on RestSharp) that implements command polling and data uploading in a common library that is shared by all clients and the server.  The ultimate proof of the cross-platform promise of .NET and Mono will be shown by a brief code review of the sensor base classes and by comparing the large amount of code that resides in the base classes to the very small amount of code which is client-specific.  The final demonstration of cross-platform goodness will be a look into the unit testing strategy that allows common client code to be tested in Visual Studio and compiled without modification in MonoDevelop.  There are no #IFDEFs here!  This talk will discuss architectural design choices and constraints in the beginning, but the bulk of the presentation will highlight working code and demonstrations of .NET core logic being easily retargeted into MonoDevelop and Visual Studio.  This project largely succeeded due to the strength of the Xamarin tool suite and the awesome compatibility of .NET/C# between platforms.  The presenters will emphasize design commonality, code reuse, and testability based on these strengths.",
