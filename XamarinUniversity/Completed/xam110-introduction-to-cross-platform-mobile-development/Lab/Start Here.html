        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This class is meant as a follow up to the Intro to iOS and Android classes, this course introduces how to create solutions that have multiple platform targeted applications and how to maximize code sharing between them.
        </p>

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>
            3 Hours

            <li><div class="objective">Nuget and the Xamarin Component Store</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part1">Worksheet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br />
            Quick demonstration of sharable components available from Nuget and the Xamarin Component Store.

            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            One way to share code across platforms is to compile the same source files into each project. In this exercise, we will examine sharing code at the source-level with the new Shared Project feature in Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and Xamarin Studio 5.
            </li>

            <li><div class="objective">Working with Portable Class Libraries</div>
            <a href="./parts/worksheet.html#part3">Worksheet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            A completely different style of code sharing is to share assemblies between projects - in this section, we will look at Portable Class Libraries and how to use them effectively in your projects to maximize the amount of code we can share.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
        This is a cross-platform class which has projects for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8. To complete the coding exercise for this class, you will need either a Windows or OS X setup, or both to use all three platforms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Xamarin Studio + Mac OS X</strong>
            <br />
            You will need a computer with Mac OS X, Apple's XCode development environment, the Android SDK and Xamarin 3.0 installed. You will then be able to execute the iOS and Android projects. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visual Studio + Windows</strong>
            <br />
            You will need a Windows computer with Visual Studio 2013 (Update 2) with the Windows Phone 8 SDK and Xamarin 3.0 installed. In addition, to execute the iOS project, you will need a Mac OS X build machine.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If you need help setting up your environment, <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/" target="_blank">try going through the online setup</a> instructions. In addition, we have documented all the setup requirements and have walk-through videos on the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements" target="_blank">Xamarin University website</a>.
