        <h1>Exercise 1: Creating our first iOS application with Xamarin Studio</h1>
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>15 minutes</p>

        <h2>Lab Goals</h2>
        <p>
        The primary goal of this lab will be to walk through the creation of a brand new Xamarin.iOS application using Xamarin Studio. As part of this exercise, we will walk through the solution structure, and show all the moving parts as your application is built, deployed and run. This is a code-along lab, which should be done in tandem with an online instructor for Xamarin University.
        </p>

        If you would like to work through this on your own, then watch the recorded version of this session and follow along with the recording.</p>
