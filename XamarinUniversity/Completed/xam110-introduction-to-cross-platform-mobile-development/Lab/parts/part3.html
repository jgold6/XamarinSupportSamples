        <h1>Exercise 3: Working with Portable Class Libraries</h1>
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>20 minutes</p>

        <h2>Lab Goals</h2>
        <p>
        We will work on the same project we did in <a href="./part2.html">Part 2</a>, but this time we will use a Portable Class Library to share our Json data loading between the iOS, Android and Windows Phone projects. We will be starting <em>almost</em> where you left off in the last exercise, without the Shared Project implementation, but the code in the three platform projects has already been filled out.
        </p>
        <p>We will need to do the following steps</p>
        <ol class="indent-medium">
            <li>Create a new Portable Class Library Project</li>
            <li>Add the 2 shared source files (<strong>Song.cs</strong> and <strong>SongLoader.cs</strong>) to the shared project - these are the same files you started with in the last exercise.</li>
            <li>Add a reference to the PCL to each of your target projects</li>
            <li>Add a Nuget reference to Newtonsoft's Json.net parser to the PCL (it is already in each of the target projects).</li>
            <li>Create an abstraction to open a <code>Stream</code> and implement it for each of our platform projects.</li>
            <li>Use the abstraction in the portable code.</li>
            <li>As a final optional step, we will move the data file into the PCL as a resource and then share the resource across all three projects.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Development Environment Notes</h2>
        <h3>Xamarin Studio on the Mac</h3>
        <p>
            You will only be able to load two of the three projects - Windows Phone is not a supported platform and you will get an error indicating the project cannot be loaded. It is safe to ignore this error; just work with the iOS and 
            Android portions of the lab.
        </p>

        <h2>Required Assets</h2>
        <p>
        There are included resources in the <strong>Part 03 Resources</strong> folder which are needed to complete this exercise. These are included with the course materials, so make sure you have them available before starting.</p>

        <h2>Exercise Challenge</h2>
        <p>
        Using the <a href="./worksheet.html#part3">Worksheet</a> to give you the information you need, try to accomplish the lab goals on your own. If you need some additional help, there are <a href="#steps">step-by-step instructions below</a> which you can use if you get stuck or need a hint.
        </p>

        <h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>
        
        <h2>Open the Starter Solution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the starting project <strong>MyTunes</strong> included in the <strong>Part 03 Resources</strong> folder with either Xamarin Studio on the Mac, or Visual Studio on Windows.</li>
            <li>The projects <u>will not build</u> currently as the required shared code has been removed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Add the Portable Class Library</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Right click on the solution node and add a new project.</li>
            <li>Select Class Library (Portable) project type - it can be found under C# if everything is configured properly. See the screen shots below if you are having trouble.</li>
            <li>Name the project &quot;MyTunes.Shared&quot;</li>
            <li>You can delete the empty class file added by default into the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <img src="./res/images/Create-PCL-XS.png" />
        <img src="./res/images/Create-PCL-VS.png" />

        <ol start="4">
            <li>On Visual Studio, it will prompt you for the platforms to support. Select the choices as shown below:</li>
        </ol>

        <img src="./res/images/PCL_targets-VS.png" />

        <ol start="5">
            <li>On Xamarin Studio, the default profile (Profile78) is acceptable.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Add the code into the Portable Class Library</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <strong>Part 03 Resources</strong> folder there is a <strong>data</strong> sub-folder with two C# source files:</li>
            <ul class="indent-none">
                <li><strong>Song.cs</strong> - this defines a class which provides information about a single song.</li>
                <li><strong>SongLoader.cs</strong> - this is a class which can parse a JSON file off disk into a set of <code>Song</code> objects. It utilizes the Newtonsoft Json.net parser.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add both C# files to your shared project - you can add existing files to shared projects in the normal fashion.</li>
            <li>These are the same files you used in Part 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Add a Nuget reference to Json.net</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Nuget references for the Portable Class Library - in Visual Studio, this is available as an option on the <strong>References</strong> folder, on Xamarin Studio you need to right-click on the <strong>Project</strong> node and select: <strong>Add > Add Packages...</strong></li>
            <img src="./res/images/AddReference-XamStudio.png" />
            <li>Search online and find the Json.net component - it should be one of the first packages displayed due to it's popularity.</li>
            <img src="./res/images/AddPackage-XS.png" />
            <img src="./res/images/AddPackage-VS.png" />
        </ol>

        <h2>Add a Reference to the PCL</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a reference to the PCL for each of the target projects you want to work with (iOS | Windows | Android).</li>
            <li>The projects should now all build properly - however they will fail at runtime becuase we've not added the code to load the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Create the File abstraction</h2>
        <p>The <strong>songs.json</strong> file is located in each of the platform projects - just as we had it in the Shared Project version of this exercise.</p>
        <p>Since we've got the data file stored in a platform-specific way, we will need to use platform-specific code to get to our data.</p>
        <p>Since this is a separate DLL, we can't just add the code into the library. In addition, because it's a Portable Library, file I/O is prohibited - we can only work with <code>Stream</code>s. So wee need to create an abstraction. In this case, it's quite simple and we could just use an event - however, let's use an interface just to see the whole idea.</p>
        <ol class="indent-medium">
            <li>Create a new interface in the PCL. Name it <code>IStreamLoader</code>.</li>
            <li>It should have a single method which takes a filename and returns a <code>Stream</code></li>
            <li>Name the method <strong>GetStreamForFilename</strong>.</li>
            <li>Next, we need to implement this interface in each of our platform projects.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Implement the abstraction</h2>
        <p>Use each of the specific platform instructions to implement the <code>IStreamLoader</code> abstraction.</p>

        <h3>iOS</h3>
        <ol class="indent-medium">
            <li>Use the <code>System.IO.File.OpenRead</code> method to open the filename.</li>
            <li>Make sure the iOS project builds.</li>
        </ol>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'openFile_ios');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
            <div class="indent-large" id="openFile_ios" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
class StreamLoader : IStreamLoader
{
    public Stream GetStreamForFilename(string filename)
    {
        return File.OpenRead(filename);
    }
}
</pre>               
            </div>
        </p>

        <h3>Android</h3>
        <ol class="indent-medium">
            <li>Pass in a <code>Context</code> to the constructor of your implementation and save it into a field - this will make it easy to get to assets.</li>
            <li>Use the <code>Context.Assets.Open</code> method to open the filename.</li>
            <li>Make sure the Android project builds.</li>
        </ol>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'openFile_droid');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
            <div class="indent-large" id="openFile_droid" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public class StreamLoader : IStreamLoader
{
    private readonly Context context;

    public StreamLoader(Context context)
    {
        this.context = context;
    }
    public Stream GetStreamForFilename(string filename)
    {
        return context.Assets.Open(filename);
    }
}
</pre>               
            </div>
        </p>

        <h3>Windows Phone</h3>
        <ol class="indent-medium">
            <li>Use the <code>Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync</code> method to open the filename. This returns a <code>StorageFile</code>.</li>
            <li>Because it's async, we would normally use <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> like we did in the last exercise. However, that would change our interface contract - which we don't want to do. So, in this case, use the <code>AsTask()</code> extension method and then get the <code>Result</code> property to get the <code>StorageFile</code> - this will cause the call to be synchronous.</li>
            <li>Call <code>OpenStreamForRead().Result</code> on the <code>StorageFile</code> to retrieve a <code>Stream</code>.</li>
            <li>Make sure the Windows Phone project builds.</li>
        </ol>
<p><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'openFile_wp8');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
            <div class="indent-large" id="openFile_wp8" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public class StreamLoader : IStreamLoader
{
    public Stream GetStreamForFilename(string filename)
    {
        return Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync(filename)
            .AsTask().Result
            .OpenStreamForReadAsync().Result;
    }
}
</pre>               
            </div>
        </p>

        <h2>Inject the abstraction</h2>
        <p>Next, we need to provide the abstraction to the PCL. Again, we could use a variety of techniques here, and you are encouraged to try different variations if you have time. In this case, we will add a static property to the <code>SongLoader</code> class and set it prior to calling <code>Load</code>. We could also pass it into the <code>Load</code> method, or change the class to be non-static and then pass it into a constructor. Any of these would be valid - with the constructor form probably the most ideal since we really do need the abstraction to execute.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>SongLoader.cs</strong> file and add a public static property named <strong>Loader</strong> of type <code>IStreamLoader</code>.</li>
            <li>Edit the <code>OpenData</code> method to test the property for <code>null</code> and then use it to open the filename.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'use_interface');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
            <div class="indent-large" id="use_interface" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
public static class SongLoader
{
    const string Filename = "songs.json";
    ...
    <span class="highlight">public static IStreamLoader Loader { get; set; }</span>

    private static Stream OpenData()
    {
<span class="highlight">        if (Loader == null)
            throw new Exception("Must set platform Loader before calling Load.");

        return Loader.GetStreamForFilename(Filename);
</span>
    }
}
</pre>               
            </div>
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Next, set the property in each of your platforms to your implementation, this should be done just before you call <code>SongLoader.Load</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Test the applications</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Run each of the platforms - they should all display the song list.</li>
        </ol>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="./res/images/android-final.png" /></td>
                <td><img src="./res/images/ios-final.png" /></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="./res/images/wp-final.png" /></td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Share the data file (Optional)</h2>
        <p>It turns out there's a way to structure this code where we don't need any platform support at all. This isn't always possible, but in this case we can add the file to the shared PCL assembly and then load it directly from our code.</p>
        <p>The secret to this is to use the <strong>EmbeddedResource</strong> build action. This is a .NET build action that is supported for all variants of .NET and we can then use <code>Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream</code> to read the data from our PCL assembly. We could have used this same approach for the Shared Project as well.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the <strong>songs.json</strong> file to the PCL - there is a copy in the <strong>Part 03 Resources/data</strong> folder.</li>
            <li>Change the build action to <strong>EmbeddedResource</strong>.</li>
            <li>Get the PCL assembly using <code>typeof(SongLoader).GetTypeInfo().Assembly</code>. This works in all targets, unlike <code>Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly</code> which is not available in the PCL.</li>
            <li>use the <code>Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream</code> method to get the stream - the name of the resource will be &quot;MyTunes.Shared.songs.json&quot; (assuming the namespace for the assembly is <code>MyTunes.Shared</code>).</li>
            <li>You can then create a <code>StreamReader</code> from the given stream.</li>
            <li>If it fails to find the resource at runtime, check the name you are using. You can also load the PCL assembly into <strong>ILDasm</strong>, <strong>Reflector</strong>, or <strong>ILSpy</strong> to see what the actual resource name is for the file.</li>
            <li>Test the final code for all three platform variations - it should still run properly, but now you can remove the <strong>songs.json</strong> from each platform!</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
        In this exercise, we have created a Portable Class Library and used it in an iOS, Android and Windows Phone application. The library had both platform-agnostic code, as well as some platform-specific code executed through an interface.
